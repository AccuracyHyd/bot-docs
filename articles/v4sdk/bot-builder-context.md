<!--
Sequence:
- The bot application receives an activity from a channel. (Who sends it? BCS->Listener->Adapter. Adapter manages the rest of 
the processing/sequence.
- If the MW was added, the activity is sent to the MW. (Sent by whom? Adapter's RunPipeline method)
- If MW does not short-circuits the pipeline, then Bot's OnReceiveActivity method is called. (Called by whom? By the Adapter's
RunPipeline method)
- If there are any responses generated, they are sent back to the user through the channels. (Sent back by whom? Adapter's RunPipeline)

# The context object
The context object provides all the information about the conversation, channels, user, request, and response needed to process the activity. The bot adapter creates a _context_ object in response to an incoming activity, and includes the activity in the context's request property. The adapter passes the context to your bot's _on receive_ handler which has your application logic. Any middleware you've added also participates in handling the context object.

## Notable properties

The _adapter_ property contains a reference to your bot's adapter. Your application logic and middleware can use this property to access your adapter when processing an activity. For example, you can use the adapter property to continue existing conversation. 

The _conversation reference_ property identifies the conversastion, the bot, and the user participating in it among other things. You can use a conversation reference to send _proactive messages_ to the user.
<!--TODO: See [Proactive messaging]-->

The _request_ property contains the incoming activity from the user. The activity often contains a message from the user, but it can also represent the start or end of a conversation and other types of information. 
<!--TODO: Add some task-specific info.-->
<!--TODO: See [activities overview]() for information about activities in general.-->

The _responses_ property collects the outgoing activities generated by your bot's middleware and your application logic. 

> [!Note] If you use intent recognizer middleware, the context's _top intent_ property will contain the highest-scoring intent, as determined by the recognizer your bot is using.

## Notable methods
Use the context's _reply_ method to queue an activity as a response to the user on the current conversation.
Use _get or set_ methods to access state information.  

## Bot state
<!-- TODO: Add State, Recognizer -->
The bot itself is stateless. The context object exists only during the pipeline processing of the specific activity for which it was created. Conversation and user state can be stored using the state middleware and accessed using the get/set methods. The adapter can save and restore state using state manager middleware paired with a storage object. (Without using some process to save and restore state, the context's state is discarded at the end of each activity processing cycle.) State information is dynamically typed. 

The SDK provides the ability to store conversation and user data separately. To persist conversation or user data, you need to create a class derived from IStoreItems. You can use the context object's Get or Set method to access/store this information. For more details, see, [Storing data](bot-builder-storage-concept.md)
