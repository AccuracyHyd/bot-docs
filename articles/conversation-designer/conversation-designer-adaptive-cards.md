# Configure adaptive cards

<a href="http://adaptivecards.io" target="_blank">Adaptive Cards</a> is a new schema that defines rich UI cards for use in several 
different endpoints including Microsoft Bot Framework channels. 

Conversation Designer provides a deeply integrated authoring environment to author, preview, and use adaptive cards in your bots. 

Adaptive cards can be defined in several different key places.

- A simple response to [action](conversation-designer-actions.md) for a task.
- In feedback state in a dialog.
- In prompt states in a dialog. Note that prompts can have separate cards: one for the response and another for re-prompting.

To define an adaptive card, navigate to the relevant editor. Browse and choose from one of the existing Adaptive Card 
Templates or build your own in the JSON code editor. 

<!--TODO: Insert screenshot -->

As you are building a card, a rich preview of the card is rendered in the authoring portal.

## Use entities and language generation templates
Adaptive cards support full language generation resolution.

* `entityName` uses entities inside the card.
* `responseTemplateName` uses simple or conditional response templates inside the card.
