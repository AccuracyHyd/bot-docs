# Create a Conversation Designer bot from a Sample bots

Conversation Designer is a powerful framework that provides a visual bot builder, a declarative model for defining bots, and a runtime that makes creating bots simple. One way to make bot creation simple is by starting your bot from an existing bot.

You can create Conversation Designer bots from one of many sample bots or from a previously exported Conversation Designer bot. Each sample bot is a fully functional bot. This gives you a solid starting point where you can began building your own bot or customize the sample bot to fit your scenarios.

## The sample bots

Conversation Designer comes with a set of **Sample bots**. You can start building your bot based on one of these **Sample bots**. Most of these **Sample bots** cover a small scenario of a fully functional bot. If you want to see all of these sample bots function together, create the **Complete Contoso Cafe bot**. 

The table below lists the type of bots you can create with a brief description about each bot and the scenarios it covers. 

| Bot name | Scenarios | Features introduced |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Basic Bot** | A bot that has some basic capabilities hooked up. For example, this bot displays a welcome message when a new user is added to a conversation, responds to greeting messages, and executes a fallback behavior when the user asks something that the bot does not understand. | - [Tasks](conversation-designer-tasks.md) <br/>- Task triggers and actions <br/>- [Language Understanding trigger](conversation-designer-luis.md)<br/>- [Script trigger](conversation-designer-code-recognizer.md)<br/>- [Reply action](conversation-designer-reply.md) |
| **Echo Bot** | A **Basic bot** that echos back a user's message.  Whatever you send to the bot, it will echo back the message saying, "Here's what you said - ...message...". | - [Script trigger](conversation-designer-code-recognizer.md)<br/>- Interpreting the context object in code<br/>- Creating entities in code<br>- Using entities in Bot's reply |
| **QnA Bot** | A bot that can perform single-turn question and answer experience using the [QnAMaker.ai](http://qnamaker.ai). For this sample to work, you must have a [QnA Maker](http://qnamaker.ai) account set up and have trained it with some questions and answers. Then, open this **QnA bot**, go to the **Scripts** page and replace these two placeholders with your QnA Maker's info: `<INSERT YOUR KB ID>` and `<INSERT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY>`. Once you enter those two pieces of information, [save](conversation-designer-save-bot.md) the bot, and then you can [test](conversation-designer-debug-bot.md) your bot. | - [Script trigger](conversation-designer-code-recognizer.md)<br/>- Making HTTP requests from code<br/>- Wiring up to custom NLP/LU service (QnAMaker.ai in the sample) |
| **Conversation Bot** | A bot that can engage in a simple conversation and remembers context, such as the user's name. | - [Dialogue action](conversation-designer-dialogues.md)<br/>- Basic [Dialogue states](conversation-designer-dialogues.md#dialogue-states) and properties<br/>- Introduction to [Prompted Dialogue](conversation-designer-dialogues.md#prompt-state) (Defining a prompt and re-prompt behavior)<br/>- [Creating intents](conversation-designer-luis.md#create-a-new-intent) with labelled entities in prompted dialogue<br/>- Using entities generated by Language Understanding in Bot's reply<br/>- Using [cards](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md) to improve the end user experience<br/>- Binding bot entities to [input forms](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md#input-form)<br/>- Creating and using [Response template](conversation-designer-response-templates.md) bot asset |
| **Memory Bot** | A bot that can ask for the user's preferences and later recalls the information in a conversation. When you say something like "Set communication preference." This bot will ask if you like to receive communication via "Call" or "Text". You can also ask this bot for Contoso Cafe location information by saying something like, "Find cafe location" or "Get me directions to Contoso Cafe in Redmond, WA". Once the bot finds the information, it will either call you or text you the information it found. <br/><br/>If a communication preference is already set, the bot will just use that preference, otherwise it will prompt the user for it. | - [Dialogue action](conversation-designer-dialogues.md)<br/>- Save data to bot memory using [`context.global`](conversation-designer-context-object.md#context-properties)<br/>- Recalling contextual information from memory to use in a Dialogue |
| **Book a Table Bot** | A bot that can engage in a multi-turn conversation with a user to help the user book a reservation for a table at the Contoso Cafe shop. <br/><br/>To book a table, this bot needs three pieces of information from you: (1) *party size*, (2) *date/time*, and (3) *location*. <br/><br/>You can give all three pieces of information in one message by saying something like, "I'd like to book a table for 4 people at the Redmond location on Tuesday at 2pm." If you leave out any one of the three pieces of information, the bot will prompt you for it. | - [Dialogue action](conversation-designer-dialogues.md)<br/>- Complex Dialogue action with references to other Dialogue<br/>- Composing Dialogues together<br/>- Setting up your bot's Dialogue using the full power of LUIS to manage things like forward slot filling and corrections experience<br/>- Using [cards](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md) to improve the end user experience<br/>- Binding bot entities to [input forms](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md#input-form)<br/>- Creating and using [conditional response template](conversation-designer-response-templates.md#conditional-response-templates) bot asset |
| **Search Refinement Bot** | A bot that can help you refine your search using contextual information carried over from previous conversations.Â You can say things like "Is the Seattle store open this weekend?" followed by "What about the Renton store" - the bot will remember you are still talking about this weekend for the second question. You can also try things like "Which stores are open this friday at 8pm" followed by "and at 10pm"? etc | - [Dialogue action](conversation-designer-dialogues.md)<br/>- Save data to bot's memory using [`context.global`](conversation-designer-context-object.md#context-properties)<br/>- Using bot memory to have a context carry forward type conversation with user<br/>- Recalling contextual information from memory to use in a Dialogue |
| **Order a Sandwich Bot** | A bot that demonstrates different ways to prompt a user for input when taking a sandwich order. For example, this bot will help you take a sandwich order. <br/><br/>To order a sandwich, the bot requires four pieces of information: (1) *sandwich size*, (2) *bread type*, (3) *protein option*, and (4) *sandwich toppings*. <br/><br/>Similar to the **Book a Table Bot**, you can provide all four required information in one message or you can provide one at a time by saying "I like to order a sandwich please." or "Can I get a large sandwich?" and the bot will ask you for the rest of the information it needs to process your order. | - [Dialogue action](conversation-designer-dialogues.md)<br/>- Setting up [prompts](conversation-designer-response-templates.md) to collect information in different ways |
| **Contoso Cafe Bot** | A fully functional bot created for Contoso Cafe. This bot can do everything that the other sample bots do. It provides a welcome message with a rich card that you can interact with. It supports Help, Greeting, and Fallback messages. Helps you book a table or find cafe location or order a sandwich. | - All features of Conversation Designer<br/>- Save data to bot's memory using [`context.global`](conversation-designer-context-object.md#context-properties)<br/>- Using [cards](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md) to trigger into specific bot tasks based on user input (see the card with buttons in welcome message)<br/>- Building a complex bot that can perform several different [tasks](conversation-designer-tasks.md). |

## Explore sample bots

If the current sample bot you are using isn't quite what you wanted, you can switch to another sample bot at any time. You can find a list of all the sample bots in the **Explore sample bots** page.

> [!WARNING] 
> Importing a sample bot will replace the current bot with the sample bot. 
> If you do not want to loose your customization in the current bot, [export](conversation-designer-export-import-bot.md#export-a-conversation-designer-bot) it to a .zip file.

To switch to a different sample bot, do the following:
1. From the current bot, click **Explore sample bots**. You can find this option at the bottom of the left navigation panel. 
2. Pick a bot from a list of **Sample bots**, click **Import**.
3. If you want to save your work in the current bot, choose the **Backup and import** option. This option will save the current bot to your local computer and then import the new **Sample bot**. Otherwise, choose **Import without backing up**.

Your bot is now replaced with a new sample bot that you just selected.
