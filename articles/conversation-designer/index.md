Conversation Designer is a powerful framework that provides a visual bot builder, a declarative model for defining bots, and a runtime that makes creating bots simple.

Building useful conversational bots requires a unified approach to integrating conversational controls, language understanding, dialogs, and language generation, while at the same time maintaining focus on user experience and integration with existing business logic. Conversation Designer enables you to build bots with an integrated path spanning authoring, debugging, LUIS, analytics, speech recognition, and compatibility with existing Bot Framework SDK bots.

Using Conversation Designer, you can build bots that adapt easily to available input/output modalities and take advantage of the following features: 

- a powerful runtime that minimizes state management overhead
- built-in conversational states that enable easy, visual modeling of a conversation
- separation of code and bot UI
- built-in support for AI frameworks such as <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api" target="_blank">speech recognition</a>
- built-in support for language generation using simple and conditional response templates
- support for [Adaptive Cards](conversation-designer-adaptive-cards.md)
