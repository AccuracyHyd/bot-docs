# JavaScript samples for Bot Builder SDK
[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label.md)]

These samples demonstrate task-focused bots that show how to take advantage of features in the Bot Builder SDK for JavaScript. 
You can use the samples to help you quickly get started with building great bots with rich capabilities. 

Note: The SDK v4 is being actively developed and should therefore be used for experimentation only.

To get the samples, clone the [botbuilder-js](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) GitHub repository using Git.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js.git
cd samples
```

The sample bots built with the Bot Builder SDK for JavaScript are organized in the **samples** directory.
