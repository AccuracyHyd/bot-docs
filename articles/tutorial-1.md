# Enterprise Productivity Bot Scenario
The Enterprise Bot shows how you can increase your productivity by integrating a bot with your Office 365 calendar and other services.

Quickly accessing customer information without having to have a bunch of windows open is what the Enterprise Productivity Bot is all about. Using simple chat commands, a sales rep can look up a customer and check their next appointment via the Graph API and Office 365. From there they can access customer specific information stored in Dynamics CRM such as get a case or create a new one.
