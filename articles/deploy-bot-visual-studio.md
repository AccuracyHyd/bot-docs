# Deploy a bot to Azure from Visual Studio
When you build a bot with Visual Studio, you can take advantage of its built-in publish capability. This tutorial shows you to how deploy a bot to Azure directly from Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> If you created a bot with the Azure Bot Service, your bot deployment was part of the Azure Bot Service bot 
> creation process. You can re-deploy an Azure Bot Service bot from Visual studio
> [using the .PublishSettings file](azure-bot-service-continuous-deployment.md#publish-c-bot-on-app-service-plan-from-visual-studio).

## Prerequisites

You must have a Microsoft Azure subscription before you can deploy a bot to Azure. If you do not already have a subscription, you can register for a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">free trial</a>. Additionally, the process described by this article requires Visual Studio. If you do not already have Visual Studio, you can download <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2017 Community</a> for free.

## Step 1: Launch the Microsoft Azure Publishing Wizard in Visual Studio

Open your project in Visual Studio. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Publish**. This starts the Microsoft Azure publishing wizard.

## Step 2: Use the Azure Publishing Wizard to publish your bot to the cloud

Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** as the project type and click **Next**.<br/><br/>
![Select Microsoft Azure App Service and click Next](~/media/connector-getstarted-publish.png)

Create your App Service by clicking **Newâ€¦** on the right side of the dialog. <br/><br/>
![Click New to create a new Azure App Service](~/media/connector-getstarted-publish-app-service.png)

Click **Change Type** and change the service's type to Web App.
Then, name your web app and fill out the rest of the information as appropriate for your implementation. <br/><br/>
![Name your App Service, then click New App Service Plan to define one](~/media/connector-getstarted-publish-app-service-create.png)

Click **Create** to create your app service. <br/><br/>
![Create the App Service Plan by clicking Create](~/media/connector-getstarted-publish-app-service-create-spinner.png)

Copy the **Destination URL** value to the clipboard
(you'll need this value later to test the connection to the bot),
and then click **Validate Connection** to verify that the settings have been configured correctly.
If validation is successful, click **Next**. <br/><br/>

By default, your bot will be published in a Release configuration.
(If you want to debug your bot, change **Configuration** to Debug.)
Click **Publish** to publish your bot to Microsoft Azure. <br/><br/>
![Select Release Configuration and click Publish](~/media/connector-getstarted-publish-configuration.png)

> [!NOTE]
> During the publishing process, you will see a number of messages displayed in the Visual Studio 2017 Output window.
> When publishing completes, your bot's HTML page will be displayed in your default browser.

## Step 3: Test the connection to your bot
