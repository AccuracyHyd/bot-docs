## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.4" target="_blank">v1.2.4</a>

### Breaking changes

- Renamed `IFormBuilder.OnCompletionAsync` to `OnCompletion` (since the method itself is not async).
- Implemented significant changes to JSON FormFlow.
- Implemented change such that missing resources will cause an error to be thrown.

### New features

- JSON FormFlow now supports specifying everything through the JSON schema file:

    1. There is a completely seperate builder, `FormBuilderJson` which takes the schema.
    2. JSON Schema now supports message, confirmation, validation with regex and dynamically compiled code.
    3. You no longer need to specify the schema on every field.
    4. It is packaged as a seperate dll (`Microsoft.Bot.Builder.FormFlow.Json`) that depends on `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`, which brings in several dependencies.

- `LuisDialog` supports multiple `LuisModel` and `ILuisService` instances.
- New attribute `PatternAttribute` for field validation via regex.
- `IBotDataStore` now allows supplying your own storage implementation.

### Bug fixes

- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/414" target="_blank">#414</a> If an entity did not match a value, a blank string would be returned.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/434" target="_blank">#434</a> Add calculator scorable/dialog as an example of `IDialogStack.Forward` from `IScorable.PostAsync`.

- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/466" target="_blank">#466</a> Add a typed `TooManyAttemptsException` for prompts.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/472" target="_blank">#472</a> Test showing how to resolve dynamic form from container.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/416" target="_blank">#416</a> Fix bug in enumeration where if a term included numbers it would result in no match.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/440" target="_blank">#440</a> Fix syntax error in Japanese localization.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/446" target="_blank">#446</a> Expose a `Confirm` method that was mistakenly marked internal.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/449" target="_blank">#449</a> `InitialUpper` for `Normalize` did not return value.
- Make it so validation feedback is surfaced if `FeedbackOptions.Always`.
- Buttons did not include no preference.
- JSON Forms were not handling optional correctly.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.3" target="_blank">v1.2.3</a>

### Changes

- Updated FormFlow recognizers to take consistent set of args.
- Added `CancelScorable` as example of `IScorable`.
- Added sample using Azure Active Directory Authentication to access Microsoft graph.

### Bug fixes

- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/227" target="_blank">#227</a> FormFlow now handles clarification and verification of <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> entities. Initial messages are processed, then LUIS entities, and then remaining steps. 
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/335" target="_blank">#335</a> Made it so that n-gram generation would not include empty strings if there were multiple spaces. 
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/400" target="_blank">#400</a> Resolved issue with the way that ETag is set. 

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.2" target="_blank">v1.2.2</a>

### Breaking changes
- There is no longer a dependency on `Newtonsoft.Json.Schema`, so you can use `JObject.Parse` to parse your JSON Schema and define forms.

### Changes

- Made it possible to resolve root dialog from the container.
- Decoupled `IPostToBot` "middleware" from `IDialogTask`.
- Pushed lazy dialog instantiation into `DialogTask`.
- Factored out `ReactiveDialogTask` from `DialogTask`.
- Implemented forwarding of an item to child dialog.
- Added persistent dialog task.
- Added example of `AlwaysSendDirect_BotToUser`.
- Added **1** and **2** as possible responses to boolean recognizer (because buttons might send these values).

### Bug fixes

- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/227" target="_blank">#227</a> Fix issue related to processing of <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> entities.
- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/230" target="_blank">#230</a> Allow `ConnectorClientCredentials` to be injected from container.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.1" target="_blank">v1.2.1</a>

### Changes

- Ensured that <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> service queries are encoded with UTF8.

- Fixed a `Choice` prompt bug to rank complete matches higher than partial matches.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.0.1" target="_blank">v1.2.0.1</a>

### Changes

- Fixed missing dependencies for `Microsoft.Bot.Builder` 1.2.0 NuGet package.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.2.0" target="_blank">v1.2.0</a>

### Breaking changes

- Changed target framework to .NET 4.6. This change was necessary to reliably support using the thread culture for localization.
- Made it so that FormFlow `ValidateAsyncDelegate` must return the value to set in the field. This change was necessary to support programmatic value transformations.
- Changed the signature of `Conversation.Resume` to support a resumption cookie to maintain conversation state across dialog resumption.
- Moved to the latest NuGet packages, including for the Bot Framework Connector.

### New features
- System dialogs and FormFlow will now generate buttons for channels that support them. 
- FormFlow can now be driven by an extended JSON Schema that allows doing attributes in a similar way to C#.  This allows forms to be generated at run-time from data rather than C# reflection.
- System dialogs and FormFlow are localized to nine languages. (Contributions for more languages would be welcome.) We also provide tools to help generate the resource files required to localize your FormFlow state classes.
- `DateTime` parsing in English now uses **Chronic**, which supports more natural Date/Time expressions such as "tomorrow at 4".
- `LuisDialog` now supports the full <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> schema, including actions.

### Bug fixes

- Implemented general bug fixes.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.1.0" target="_blank">v1.1.0</a>

### Breaking changes

- Renamed some delegates and methods for consistency and to support dynamic field definition. This only impacts bots that were directly using `Field` or `FieldReflector`.

### Changes
- Provided a way to dynamically define fields, confirmations and messages.
- Added `FormCanceledException`, which provides information on what steps were completed and where the user quit.
- Added more flexibility on how parenthesis are used when generating prompts.
- Fixed several bugs related to initial state and <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> entities.
- Extended chain model to support branching (`Chain.Switch`).
- Added support for resumption of a conversation.
- Added example of Facebook OAuth.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.0.2" target="_blank">v1.0.2</a>

### Changes

- Moved to `IDialog<T>` typed for result type.
- Added support for LINQ query syntax (e.g. `Select`, `SelectMany`).
- Multiple `IBotToUser.Post(Message)` calls.
- Moved to `Autofac` dependency injection container.
- Made it so that `IConnectorClient` is instantiated to point to emulator when emulating bot.
- Fixed an issue with `CommandDialog<T>`.
- Updated <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a> models.
- Added `ChoiceCase`, `ChoiceParens` to Form template attributes.

## <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/1.0.1" target="_blank">v1.0.1</a>

### Changes

- Fixed `LuisDialog` to handle **null** score returned by LUIS (due to a behavior change in Cortana pre-built apps by <a href="http://luis.ai" target="_blank">LUIS</a>).
- Updated **nuspec** with better description.
- Added error-resilient context store.
